# CRUD Means

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

### CRUD Web App

A CRUD web app will let you:

* **Create** things 
  * For example: posts, articles, tasks, and/or images
* **Read**/view things
* **Update** things
* **Delete** things

CRUD web apps are usually simpler than other types of web apps. They usually have several different list of items &mdash; each of which you can delete, view, or update.

### Example

A good example: **A Blog**.

With a blog, you can:

* Create posts
* Read posts
* Update posts
* Delete posts

#### Other examples

* **Wordpress** lets you create, update, and delete blog posts and pages
* **Wikipedia** lets you create, update, and delete articles
* **Craigslist** lets you create, update, and delete postings

### Beyond CRUD

**Social networks** (e.g Twitter / Instagram / TikTok) let you like posts and follow people. 

**Analytics platforms** (e.g. Google Analytics / Hubspot) let you connect users and actions and see advanced graphs. 

These go beyond basic CRUD.
